## Our Project Outline

### We kindly request that anyone reading this text follows the step-by-step guide to understand the project.

### Step 1:

* Our program is a domestic pantry management system, and it is recommended that only one person from the household registers for it, specifically the one responsible for organizing and managing the pantry. Initially, this person creates their profile in the system, and their ID is the username they choose (we have implemented a function to prevent the registration of duplicate usernames).

### Step 2:

* After registering users, they can add items in the "Menu Items" section, where the ID of each item is the corresponding barcode. 

### Step 3:

* The final module, which has its own separate file but is linked to the user's ID, is the "Shopping List." This is where the user can check items with a low stock quantity and items close to their expiration date. Subsequently, they can create their shopping list with the desired quantity of items.
